    <h2>1. Breast Cancer </h2>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles/DiseaseImgs_css/breast.png') }}"/>
   </div>
    <p>Breast cancer happens when cells in your breast grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, creating a mass of tissue called a tumor. Signs of breast cancer can include feeling a lump in your breast, experiencing a change in the size of your breast and seeing changes to the skin on your breasts. Mammograms can help with early detection.<br></p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
      <li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast,An area that’s distinctly different from any other area on either breast.
      </li>
      <li>
        A change in the look or feel of your skin on your breast or nipple (dimpled, puckered, scaly or inflamed).

      </li>
      <li>
        A newly inverted nipple, Redness of your skin on your breast or nipple. A marble-like hardened area under your skin. A blood-stained or clear fluid discharge from your nipple.
      </li>
      <li>Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin</li>
      <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>Breast cancer develops when abnormal cells in your breast divide and multiply. But experts don’t know exactly what causes this process to begin in the first place.
      Doctors says that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.<br>
Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). 
Age - Being 55 or older increases your risk for breast cancer.
Sex - Women are much more likely to develop breast cancer than men.
Family history and genetics - If you have parents, siblings, children or other close relatives who’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer, you’re more likely to develop the disease at some point in your life. About 5% to 10% of breast cancers are due to single abnormal genes that are passed down from parents to children, and that can be discovered by genetic testing.
Smoking - Tobacco use has been linked to many different types of cancer, including breast cancer.Alcohol use. Research indicates that drinking alcohol can increase your risk for certain types of breast cancer.
Obesity - Having obesity can increase your risk of breast cancer and breast cancer recurrence.
Radiation exposure - If you’ve had prior radiation therapy — especially to your head, neck or chest — you’re more likely to develop breast cancer.
Hormone replacement therapy - People who use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have a higher risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer.




<br>
Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.</p>

<h2>2. Diabetes</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles/DiseaseImgs_css/diabetes.jpg') }}"/>
   </div>
<p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes occurs when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. And prediabetes is often the precursor of diabetes unless appropriate measures are taken to prevent progression. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy but may resolve after the baby is delivered.
</p>
<h3>Causes of diabetes</h3>
<p>Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type 1 diabetes</li>
  <p>Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.</p>
  <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
  <p>Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Being overweight or obese increases your risk too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.
  </p>
  <li> Gestational diabetes</li>
  <p>Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy.</p>
</ul>
<h3>What health problems can people with diabetes develop? </h3>
<p>Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as</p>

 <ul>
  <li>heart disease</li>
  <li>stroke</li>
  <li>Hearing Loss</li>
  <li>depression</li>
  <li>kidney disease</li>
  <li>eye problems</li>
  <li>dental disease</li>
  <li>nerve damage</li>
  <li>foot problems</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.Heart Disease</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles/DiseaseImgs_css/heart.png') }}"/>
   </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.<br>
  The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.<br>
Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
  <li>Shortness of breath</li>
  <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed</li>
  <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.Kidney Disease</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles/DiseaseImgs_css/kidney.png') }}"/>
   </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The kidneys play key roles in body function, not only by filtering the blood and getting rid of waste products, but also by balancing the electrolyte levels in the body, controlling blood pressure, and stimulating the production of red blood cells.<br>

The kidneys are located in the abdomen toward the back, normally one on each side of the spine. They get their blood supply through the renal arteries directly from the aorta and send blood back to the heart via the renal veins to the vena cava. (The term "renal" is derived from the Latin name for kidney.)<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lethargy</li>
   <li> Weakness</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
    <li>Generalized swelling (edema)</li>
    <li>Generalized weakness due to anemia</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Lethargy</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Congestive heart failure</li>
    <li>Metabolic acidosis</li>
    <li>High blood potassium (hyperkalemia)</li>
    <li>Fatal heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias) including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation</li>
    <li>
    Rising urea levels in the blood (uremia) may lead to brain encephalopathy, pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining), or low calcium blood levels (hypocalcemia)</li>
  </ul>
