## SELFCARE ROUTINE <br>

As we know we do not have any such website that consists of meditation, yoga/exercises or any kind of financial help needed altogether at one place. All these activities have different websites available focusing only on their particular domain . <br>
Hence , looking on to the community development we are concentrating on the fact that the user should find these kind of necessities at one place instead of browsing through different sites. <br>
<p>
The website will consist as follows: <br>
1.	A particular time will be allotted for every activity that will include ( meditation, yoga/exercise, financial advice/mental healthcare etc.)<br>
2.	As soon as the time will finish for an activity letâ€™s say 15 min. for each, The user will be prompted to do next activity .Eg: Firstly they will be required to do meditation so that users can total concentrate on their day-to-day hobbies. After its completion within the allotted time ,they would be advised to take up yoga exercises for maintaining their physical health.<br>
3.	Thirdly , they would be provided with financial help or any kind of advices related to mental health if they are dealing with some kind stress or anxiety. <br>
Since the users will be getting fitness updates, finance updates etc, they wont be spending their money on such issues which in turn will provide them benefits for their daily activities without any expenses.
Also, the daily performance of the users will be calculated by seeing the amount of time they have spent on that specific task.
